# Look At Me Sideways (LAMS)

`>_>`

LAMS is a LookML style guide and linter that can help your team produce more maintainable LookML models.

- The [style guide](https://fabio-looker.github.io/look-at-me-sideways/rules.html) alone can help your project, even without enforcement by the linter.
- The linter can be configured to enforce the style guide as a part of all pull requests, thought it currently only enforces a subset of the rules.
- In addition to linting, LAMS adds informative markdown files to your instance that help you navigate your project.

See a video of LAMS in action:

### Deployment

##### Docker

Although LAMS can be deployed manually using your CI tool of choice, we have provided a Docker image to simplify the deployment. Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/fabio-looker/look-at-me-sideways/blob/release/1.0/docker/README.md).

##### Manifest.lkml (optional)

If your LookML project doesn't have a manifest.lkml file, you may want to consider adding one! By specifying a 'project_name' in your manifest, LAMS will be able to generate the correct links back to your project files in your instance.

### Linter Features

##### Ruleset Support

As of the current release, the Linter enforces rules K1-4, F1-4, E1-2, and T1-10. 

It currently does not resolve `extends` references, so if you are complying with a rule via extension, use a rule exemption as noted below. 

##### Rule Exemption

One of the best practices required by the style guide is that whenever a rule is not followed, the reason should be documented in a LookML comment. In fact, the linter accepts a specific format for these exemption reasons to allow them to be checked:

```lkml
view: rollup {
  derived_table: {
    sql_trigger_value: SELECT CURRENT_DATE() ;;
    # LAMS
    # rule_exemptions: {
    #  T1: "2018-11-12 - I can't use datagroups for this super special reason and Bob said it's ok"
    # }
    sql: SELECT ...
```

We also suggest starting these reasons with the Y-M-D formatted date on which they were added, for even easier auditing in case your project has many exemptions.

##### Generated Markdown Files
One of the primary ways that LAMS gives developers feedback, in addition to passing/failing pull requests, is by adding its findings to markdown files in your project. Here is an example of a resulting markdown file as displayed in Looker:

##### Custom Rules

In addition to linting against the rules from the style guide, LAMS also has experimental support for defining custom rules:

```lkml
# in your manifest.lkml

project_name: "my_project"
# LAMS
# custom_rules: [
#  "https://path/to/your/script.js"
# ]
```

See the rules folder in the LAMS repository for examples of the function signature to export from your script.
