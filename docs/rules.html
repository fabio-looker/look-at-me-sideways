<h1>LAMS Style Guide</h1>
<p>This Look At Me Sideways (LAMS) Style Guide, as well as the associated <a href="https://github.com/fabio-looker/look-at-me-sideways">linter</a>, are designed to help make your LookML project more maintainable.</p>
<p>These rules are quite opinionated, and some people won't like them. We've tried to provide rationales throughout so you can come to your own conclusions. However, at their core, these rules are about making your LookML and SQL reusable, self-explanatory, and reliable.</p>
<p>Whenever a rule says something "must" be done, there shouldn't be any exceptions within your project. These are rules that need to be followed consistently since others will rely upon them being followed in their work elsewhere. </p>
<p>Whenever a rule says that something "should" be done, there may be reasons to deviate from these rules, and doing so will not break any assumptions elsewhere. Whenever the rule is not followed, a comment must be used to indicate the rationale to future readers of the code (Ideally, using the LAMS rule_exemptions syntax).</p>

<h1 id="key-dimensions">Key Dimensions</h1>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Implement consistent dimensions to communicate information about views' keys to developers who use the view</p>
<details id="k1"> <!-- Primary keys required -->
	<summary><b>K1.</b> Views based on tables must define 1 or more Primary Key Dimensions.</summary>
	<p><b>Note:</b> "based on a table" could be either through a `sql_table_name`, `derived_table`, or implicit table name. Essentially, it's any view that's not a "field-only view" which will be joined using `join: {sql ;;}`</p>

	<code class="block good">
	view: carriers {
		sql_table_name: faa.carriers ;;
		dimension: pk1_carrier_id {
			hidden: yes
			primary_key: yes
			sql:${TABLE}.id;;
		}
	}
  	</code>

	</details>
<details id="k2"> <!-- Primary key naming -->
	<summary><b>K2.</b> Primary Key Dimensions must be named like <code>pk{n}_{key_name}</code>...</summary>
	<p>..., where n is the total number of columns that form the primary key, and which may be omitted if it is 1, and key_name is any descriptive name.</p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> With this naming convention, anyone creating a join can conclusively find the correct logic without having to investigate:</p>

	<img src="img/pk-dimension-suggested.png" width="381" height="117" />

	<p>Additionally, anyone reading the join could conclusively verify it. </p>

	<code class="block good">
	view: membership {
	   sql_table_name: membership ;;
	   dimension: pk2_user_id {hidden:yes sql:${TABLE}.user_id;;}
	   dimension: pk2_group_id {hidden:yes sql:${TABLE}.group_id;;}
	   dimension: user_x_group {
	      hidden:yes
	      primary_key: yes
	      sql: ${pk2_user_id} || 'x' || ${pk2_group_id} ;;
	   }
	}

	explore: invitations {
	  join: membership {
	    relationship: many_to_one
	    sql_on: ${membership.pk2_user_id} = ${invitations.to_user_id}
	      AND   ${membership.pk2_group_id} = ${invitations.group_id} ;;
	    # ^ I can tell there MUST be only one membership. Looks good.
	  }
	}
	explore: users {
	  join: membership {
	    relationship: many_to_one
	    sql_on: ${membership.pk2_user_id} = ${users.id} ;;
	    # Uh-oh, something is wrong here!
	  }
	}
	</code>

	<h5>Notes</h5>

	<ul>
	<li> The number can (and must) be 0 in the rare case that you are working with a table with no primary key.</li>
	<li> The name should be descriptive outside of the context of the view. So, prefer <code>pk1_account_id</code> over <code>pk1_id</code>. This way, views that logically share one or more primary keys can be recognized.</li>
	<li> For keys with more than one column, all the numbers should be equal to the total number of columns. So, <code>pk3_a</code>, <code>pk3_b</code>, and <code>pk3_c</code>, NOT <code>pk1_a</code>, <code>pk1_b</code>, and <code>pk1_c</code>.</li>
	<li> For keys with more than one column, this does mean you would need to define it in two ways. Once this way, and once as a single concatenated dimension with <code>primary_key: yes</code> (if necessary) so Looker can use it for generating symmetric aggregates. This is a small price to pay for the many instances of time saved looking up primary key information when writing/reading explores.</li>
	<li> An earlier version of these guidelines specified a naming convention starting with <code>{n}pk</code>. This has been changed to reflect the fact that many databases do not allow column names to start with a number.</li>
	</ul>
	</details>
<details id="k3"> <!-- Primary key location -->
	<summary><b>K3.</b> Primary Key Dimensions should be defined immediately following the table definition...</summary>
	<p>... and the table definition should be defined before any other dimensions.</p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> By placing primary keys immediately below a derived table definition, users viewing the view file can more easily verify that the Primary Key Dimensions match the derived table's actual primary keys.</p>
	</details>
<details id="k4"> <!-- Primary key hidden -->
	<summary><b>K4.</b> Primary Keys Dimensions should be hidden</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> The audience for PK information is developers. They use it to inform how to join and consume tables, and they can do so equally well with a hidden field.</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> If a column that is a primary key should be user facing, you may want to expose it via a separate dimension.</p>
	</details>
<details id="k5"> <!-- Distribution dimensions -->
	<summary><b>K5.</b> Views based on tables with a <a class="subtle" href="#glossary-dist-key">distribution key</a> should define a Distribution Key Dimension...</summary>
	<p>...named like <code>pkd_{key_name}</code></p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> By naming it similarly to Primary Keys, it will be suggested to anyone joining on a view as a possible join key. At the same time, the use of a `d` instead of a number allows it to be differentiated from a primary key</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> If your database supports multiple projections of data, you may want to come up with a more sophisticated naming scheme instead.</p>
	</details>
<details id="k6"> <!-- Sort/cluster dimensions -->
	<summary><b>K6.</b> Views based on tables with a <a class="subtle" href="#glossary-sort-key">sort/cluster key</a> should define one or more Sort/Cluster Key Dimensions</summary>
	<p>...named like <code>pkc_{key_name}</code></p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> By naming it similarly to Primary Keys, it will be suggested to anyone joining on a view as a possible join key. At the same time, the use of a `c` instead of a number allows it to be differentiated from a primary key</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> The name for this concept varies greatly from database to database. "pkc" was chosen for cluster, in favor of "pks" which could be read as a "surrogate key".</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> If you have compound cluster/sort keys, it would be a good idea to include the rank of each column in the dimension name. Unlike the PK naming convention, each column should get a different numner, e.g. <code>pkc1_site, pkc2_date, pkc3_country</code>.</p>
	</details>

<h1 id="other-fields">Other Fields</h1>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Implement fields in ways which (a) maximize the ability of developers to reuse them in the future, and (b) maximize the usability of explores for end users</p>
<details id="f1"> <!-- No inter-view dependencies -->
	<summary><b>F1.</b> Fields in a view should not reference other views...</summary>
	<p>... unless this is (A) a field-only view, or (B) a tightly coupled view (provide a base explore too!)</p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> Inter-view dependencies interfere with the re-use of the view<p>
	<code class="block bad">
	view: users {...}
	view: orders {
	  ...
	  measure: orders_per_user {
	    sql: ${count} / NULLIF(${users.count},0)
	  }
	}
	explore: orders {} # Errors :(
	</code>

	<code class="block good">
	view: users {...}
	view: orders {...}
	view: users_orders {
	  # No need for a sql_table_name or derived_table
	  measure: orders_per_user {
	    sql: ${orders.count} / NULLIF(${users.count},0)
	  }
	}
	explore: orders {} #Doesn't break like before!
	explore: users {
	  join: orders {...}
	  join: users_orders {
	    sql: ;;
	    # Use `sql` instead of `sql_on` and put some whitespace in it
	    relationship: one_to_one
	    view_label: "Orders" #For cleaner explore UI
	  }
	}
	</code>
	</details>
<details id="f2"> <!-- No view-labeled fields -->
	<summary><b>F2.</b> Fields should not contain a view_label.</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> Field-level view labels can't be overridden by a join. Prefer view-level view labels.</p>
	</details>
<details id="f3"> <!-- Count fields filtered -->
	<summary><b>F3.</b> All type:count measures must specify a filter</summary>
	<p>"Plain" count fields can/should specify a filter of "primary key dimensions (or any non-nullable field) are not null"</p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> By default Looker will implement any non-filtered & non-distinct count field as a `COUNT(*)`. Filtering such "plain" counts on PK IS NOT NULL ensures correct counts in all of the following uses of the field: Counting just that table, counting that table when joined on as a one-to-one-or-zero table, counting that table with symmetric aggregates when joined on as a many_to_one table, and counting that table in explores with join paths.</b>
	<code class="block good">
	measure: count {
		type: count
		filters:{
			field: pk1_user_id
			value: "NOT NULL"
		}
	}
	</code>
	<p><b>Note:</b> The <a href="https://docs.looker.com/reference/filter-expressions">LookML filter syntax</a> for "is not null" varies depending on the type of the field. For strings, use <code>-NULL</code>. For numbers, use <code>NOT NULL</code>.</p>
	</details>
<details id="f4"> <!-- Description or hidden -->
	<summary><b>F4.</b> Non-hidden fields should have descriptions</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> User experience. Just do it.</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> Think about the audience when you write a description. Information for end users can go in the description, whereas information for other developers can go in a LookML comment</p>
	</details>
<details id="f5"> <!-- ID fields hidden -->
	<summary><b>F5.</b> ID fields that do not have a business usage should be hidden</summary>
	<code class="good block">
	view: order_items { ... pk1_order_item_id {hidden:yes}}
	</code>
	</details>
<details id="f6"> <!-- FK ID fields hidden -->
	<summary><b>F6.</b> ID fields that DO have a business usage should still be hidden when they are a foreign key</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> The ID field will make most sense for end users when they are exposed under the view for which they are a primary key.</p>
	<code class="bad block">
	view: order_items { ... dimension: order_id { ... description: "..." } }
	view: orders { ... dimension: id { ... hidden:yes }}
	</code>
	<code class="good block">
	view: order_tems { ... dimension: order_id { hidden:yes }}
	view: orders { ... dimension: id {... description: "..." }}
	</code>
	</details>

<h1 id="derived-tables">Derived Tables</h1>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Restrict the ways in which you write the SQL for derived tables in order to make them more modular and their results more realiable and understandable.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> These rules in particular use a lot of "must" statements. This is for a reason. If they seem hard to comply with at first, they're trying to tell you something :)</p>
<details id="t1"> <!-- Triggers use datagroups -->
	<summary><b>T1.</b> Triggered PDTs should use datagroups</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> <code>sql_trigger_value</code> is an older construct and can have subtle timing issues when multiple tables interact.</p>
	</details>
<details id="t2"> <!-- Primary keys required -->
	<summary><b>T2.</b> Except for exceptions in T9 & T10, every query, derived table, CTE, or subquery must SELECT a set of primary key columns following rules T3-T8</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> Primary keys define a contract that allows anyone reviewing the logic of a query to evaluate it modularly.
	Without them, any attempt to troubleshoot a query requires an arbitrarily deep investigation of related subqueries.
	With them, each query and subquery can be evaluated independently against their declared PK and the declared PK's of the participating tables.</p>

	<code class="good block">
	view: user_lifetime {derived_table: {sql:

	</code>
	<p><b>Note:</b> If you are using _in_query to generate a dynamic derived table where a column may or may not be present in the derived table's primary key, you should always select a static number of PK columns and conditionally NULL out their values, rather than selecting a dynamic number of columns.</p>

	<code class="bad block">
	view: dynamic_events_rollup {derived_table: {sql:

	<h5>Notes</h5>
	<ul>
	<li>In most cases, unless you <i>intend</i> to use a window function to create sequence numbers within a partition, the primary key should simply be ALL of the grouped by fields.</li>
	<li>If you want to join a derived table on only a subset of its columns, what you probably want is to groups by ONLY those columns and then aggregate the rest (see example below)</li>
	</ul>
	<code class="block bad">

<details id="t14"><!-- No dynamic persisted tables -->

	<p>To clarify, liquid/dynamic SQL in non-persisted, aka ephemeral, derived tables is fine.</p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> Triggered persistent tables usually don't have the necessary explore context to correctly evaluate the dynamic logic. And even persists_for derived tables do not work as expected with dynamic SQL (confirmed as of v5.14)</p>

	<p><b>Rationale:</b> More often than not, developers use UNION instead of UNION ALL unintentionally, with terrible performance implications. Therefore, if you actually need a plain UNION, make that explicit in an accompanying comment.</p>

	<p><b>Note:</b> Sometimes you may want to make joins dynamic using <code>_in_query</code>. This requires you to reference fields to join on IF the view is <code>_in_query</code> but NOT use the substitution operator since that forces the view to be in the query.</p>

	<p><b>Note:</b> In the EAV example, even though the first part of the primary key, the distribution key, and the sort/cluster key all result in `entity_id`, writing them out multiple times with the different key dimensions communicates what they do to anyone reading the join, and should have negligible performance impact.</p>

<p>The following subjects are not in the scope of this ruleset, but are still valuable to know about! These contain links to the most useful resources I could find on these subjects<p>
<details>
	<summary>Change management</summary>
	<p>This is something I really wanted to include, but was not able to this time around. Something like semver. Hopefully a future version will include this. (Pull requests will be considered!)</p>
	</details>
<details>
	<summary>Defining distribution, sort/cluster keys, indexes, etc</summary>
	<p>These are super important, but the strategy for these is too broad and complex to fit into this kind of ruleset.</p>
	<!--However, you can check out some of these useful resources: <ol>

	<summary>EAV Schemas</summary>
	<p>Entity-Attribute-Value schemas come with their own modeling challenges, but are not relevant to many models, so I decided to leave them out of this ruleset, for now.</p>
	<p>However, you can get some guidance by studying these two articles:

<details>
	<summary>Deprecated Rules</summary>
	<ul>
	<li>Rule F7 previously recommended proactively exposing "summary" measures for your dimensions. While summary measures can still be useful for select dimensions, the release of custom measures which explore users can automatically generate from a dimension in the Explore UI renders this practice no longer as important.</li>
