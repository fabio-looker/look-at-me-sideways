<p>Hi, welcome to my LookML & SQL rules!</p>
<p>This is a work in progress.</p>
<p>Also, these rules are quite opinionated, and some people won't like them. I've tried to provide rationales throughout so you can come to your own conclusions. However, at their core, these rules are about making your LookML and SQL reusable, self-explanatory, and reliable.</p>
<p>Whenever a rule says something "must" be done, there shouldn't be any exceptions within your project. These are rules that need to be followed consistently since others will rely upon them being followed in their work elsewhere. </p>
<p>Whenever a rule says that something "should" be done, there may be reasons to deviate from these rules, and doing so will not break any assumptions elsewhere. Whenever the rule is not followed, a comment must be used to indicate the rationale to future readers of the code. </p>

<h1 id="key-dimensions">Key Dimensions</h1>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Implement consistent dimensions to communicate information about views' keys to developers who use the view</p>
<details id="k1"> <!-- Primary keys required -->
	<summary><b>K1.</b> Views based on tables must define 1 or more Primary Key Dimensions.</summary>
	<p><b>Note:</b> "based on a table" could be either through a `sql_table_name`, `derived_table`, or implicit table name. Essentially, it's any view that's not a "field-only view" which will be joined using `join: {sql ;;}`</p>

	<code class="block good">
	view: carriers {
		sql_table_name: faa.carriers ;;
		dimension: 1pk_carrier_id {
			hidden: yes
			primary_key: yes
			sql:${TABLE}.id;;
		}
	}
  	</code>

	</details>
<details id="k2"> <!-- Primary key naming -->
	<summary><b>K2.</b> Primary Key Dimensions must be named like <code>{n}pk_{key_name}</code>...</summary>
	<p>..., where n is the total number of columns that form the primary key, and which may be omitted if it is 1, and key_name is any descriptive name.</p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> With this naming convention, anyone creating a join can conclusively find the correct logic without having to investigate:</p>

	<img src="img/pk-dimension-suggested.png" width="381" height="117" />

	<p>Additionally, anyone reading the join could conclusively verify it. </p>

	<code class="block good">
	view: membership {
	   sql_table_name: membership ;;
	   dimension: 2pk_user_id {hidden:yes sql:${TABLE}.user_id;;}
	   dimension: 2pk_group_id {hidden:yes sql:${TABLE}.group_id;;}
	   dimension: user_x_group {
	      hidden:yes
	      primary_key: yes
	      sql: ${2pk_user_id} || 'x' || ${2pk_group_id} ;;
	   }
	}

	explore: invitations {
	  join: membership {
	    relationship: many_to_one
	    sql_on: ${membership.2pk_user_id} = ${invitations.to_user_id}
	      AND   ${membership.2pk_group_id} = ${invitations.group_id} ;;
	    # ^ I can tell there MUST be only one membership. Looks good.
	  }
	}
	explore: users {
	  join: membership {
	    relationship: many_to_one
	    sql_on: ${membership.2pk_user_id} = ${users.id} ;;
	    # Uh-oh, something is wrong here!
	  }
	}
	</code>

	<h5>Notes</h5>

	<ul>
	<li> The number can (and must) be 0 in the rare case that you are working with a table with no primary key.
	<li> For keys with more than one column, all the numbers should be equal to the total number of columns. So, <code>3pk_a</code>, <code>3pk_b</code>, and <code>3pk_c</code>, NOT <code>1pk_a</code>, <code>2pk_b</code>, and <code>3pk_c</code>.
	<li> For keys with more than one column, this does mean you would need to define it in two ways. Once this way, and once as a single concatenated dimension with <code>primary_key: yes</code> (if necessary) so Looker can use it for generating symmetric aggregates. This is a small price to pay for the many instances of time saved looking up primary key information when writing/reading explores.
	</ul>

	</details>
<details id="k3"> <!-- Primary key location -->
	<summary><b>K3.</b> Primary Key Dimensions should be defined immediately following the table definition...</summary>
	<p>... and the table definition should be defined before any other dimensions.</p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> By placing primary keys immediately below a derived table definition, users viewing the view file can more easily verify that the Primary Key Dimensions match the derived table's actual primary keys.</p>
	</details>
<details id="k4"> <!-- Primary key hidden -->
	<summary><b>K4.</b> Primary Keys Dimensions should be hidden</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> The audience for PK information is developers. They use it to inform how to join and consume tables, and they can do so equally well with a hidden field.</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> If a column that is a primary key should be user facing, you may want to expose it via a separate dimension.</p>
	</details>
<details id="k5"> <!-- Distribution dimensions -->
	<summary><b>K5.</b> Views based on tables with a <a class="subtle" href="#glossary-dist-key">distribution key</a> should define a Distribution Key Dimension...</summary>
	<p>...named like <code>dpk_{key_name}</code></p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> By naming it similarly to Primary Keys, it will be suggested to anyone joining on a view as a possible join key. At the same time, the use of a `d` instead of a number allows it to be differentiated from a primary key</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> If your database supports multiple projections of data, you may want to come up with a more sophisticated naming scheme instead.</p>
	</details>
<details id="k6"> <!-- Sort dimensions -->
	<summary><b>K6.</b> Views based on tables with a <a class="subtle" href="#glossary-sort-key">sort key</a> should define one or more Sort Key Dimensions</summary>
	<p><b>Note:</b> The name for this concept varies greatly from database to database, and you may want your naming scheme to reflect the native name for this concept in your particular database. "sk" is also not ideal in that it could be read as "surrogate key".</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> If you have compound sort keys, it would be a good idea to include the rank of each column in the dimension name. Unlike the PK naming convention, each column should get a different numner, e.g. <code>idx1_site, idx2_date, idx3_country</code>.</p>
	</details>

<h1 id="other-fields">Other Fields</h1>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Implement fields in ways which (a) maximize the ability of developers to reuse them in the future, and (b) maximize the usability of explores for end users</p>
<details id="f1"> <!-- No inter-view dependencies -->
	<summary><b>F1.</b> Fields in a view should not reference other views...</summary>
	<p>... unless this is (A) a field-only view, or (B) a tightly coupled view (provide a base explore too!)</p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> Inter-view dependencies interfere with the re-use of the view<p>
	<code class="block bad">
	view: users {...}
	view: orders {
	  ...
	  measure: orders_per_user {
	    sql: ${count} / NULLIF(${users.count},0)
	  }
	}
	explore: orders {} # Errors :(
	</code>

	<code class="block good">
	view: users {...}
	view: orders {...}
	view: users_orders {
	  # No need for a sql_table_name or derived_table
	  measure: orders_per_user {
	    sql: ${orders.count} / NULLIF(${users.count},0)
	  }
	}
	explore: orders {} #Doesn't break like before!
	explore: users {
	  join: orders {...}
	  join: users_orders {
	    sql: ;;
	    # Use `sql` instead of `sql_on` and put some whitespace in it
	    relationship: one_to_one
	    view_label: "Orders" #For cleaner explore UI
	  }
	}
	</code>
	</details>
<details id="f2"><!-- No view-labeled fields -->
	<summary><b>F2.</b> Fields should not contain a view_label.</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> Field-level view labels can't be overridden by a join. Prefer view-level view labels.</p>
	</details>
<details id="f3"><!-- Count fields filtered -->
	<summary><b>F3.</b> All type:count measures must specify a filter</summary>
	<p>"Plain" count fields can/should specify a filter of "primary key dimensions (or any non-nullable field) are not null"</p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> By default Looker will implement any non-filtered & non-distinct count field as a `COUNT(*)`. Filtering such "plain" count on PK IS NOT NULL ensures correct counts in all of the following uses of the field: Counting just that table, counting that table when joined on as a one-to-one-or-zero table, counting that table with symmetric aggregates when joined on as a many_to_one table, and counting that table in explores with join paths.</b>
	<code class="block good">
	measure: count {
		type: count
		filters:{
			field: 1pk_user_id
			value: "-null"
		}
	}
	</code>
	</details>
<details id="f4"> <!-- Description or hidden -->
	<summary><b>F4.</b> Non-hidden fields should have descriptions</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> User experience. Just do it.</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> Think about the audience when you write a description. Information for end users can go in the description, whereas information for other developers can go in a LookML comment</p>
	</details>
<details id="f5"> <!-- ID fields hidden -->
	<summary><b>F5.</b> ID fields that do not have a business usage should be hidden</summary>
	<code class="good block">
	view: order_items { ... 1pk_order_item_id {hidden:yes}}
	</code>
	</details>
<details id="f6"> <!-- FK ID fields hidden -->
	<summary><b>F6.</b> ID fields that DO have a business usage should still be hidden when they are a foreign key</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> The ID field will make most sense for end users when they are exposed under the view for which they are a primary key.</p>
	<code class="bad block">
	view: order_items { ... dimension: order_id { ... description: "..." } }
	view: orders { ... dimension: id { ... hidden:yes }}
	</code>
	<code class="good block">
	view: order_tems { ... dimension: order_id { hidden:yes }}
	view: orders { ... dimension: id {... description: "..." }}
	</code>
	</details>
<details id="f7"> <!-- Summary measures -->
	<summary><b>F7.</b> Views should provide summary measures</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> Models tend to default to providing dimensions for every column. However, grouping by every field in the query is often not what users want. Trust your explore users to understand the nuance and give them both options.</p>
	<code class="good block">
	view: sessions {
		...
		dimension: source {}
		dimension: campaign {}
		dimension: device {}
		dimension: country {}
		measure: _source {
			type: string

		measure: _device {
			type: string

			WHEN COUNT(${device}) = 0 THEN NULL
			WHEN COUNT(${device}) = 1 THEN MIN(${device})
			WHEN MIN(${device}) = MAX(${device}) THEN MIN(${device})||' (x'||COUNT(${device})::varchar||')'

		;;}
		measure: sessions {
			type: count
			filters: {field:id filter:"-null"}
		}
	}
	</code>
	<p><b>Note:</b> In some cases, you may wish to use distinct counts instead of counts in your summary measures, or LISTAGGs/GROUP_CONCATs, but do so with the knowledge that it comes at an increased performance cost, even if not in the chosen case branch.</p>
	</details>

<h1 id="derived-tables">Derived Tables</h1>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Restrict the ways in which you write the SQL for derived tables in order to make them more modular and their results more realiable and understandable.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> These rules in particular use a lot of "must" statements. This is for a reason. If they seem hard to comply with at first, they're trying to tell you something :)</p>
<details id="t1"> <!-- Triggers use datagroups -->
	<summary><b>T1.</b> Triggered PDTs should use datagroups</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> <code>sql_trigger_value</code> is an older construct and can have subtle timing issues when multiple tables interact.</p>
	</details>
<details id="t2"> <!-- Primary keys required -->
	<summary><b>T2.</b> Except for exceptions in T9 & T10, every query, derived table, CTE, or subquery must SELECT a set of primary key columns following rules T3-T8</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> Primary keys define a contract that allows anyone reviewing the logic of a query to evaluate it modularly.
	Without them, any attempt to troubleshoot a query requires an arbitrarily deep investigation of related subqueries.
	With them, each query and subquery can be evaluated independently against their declared PK and the declared PK's of the participating tables.</p>

	<p><b>Rationale:</b> Since this style of query/subquery simply passes on the PK attributes of the referenced table/query, it's reasonable to save time writing this query and for readers of your query to go find that PK information in that single other table/query.</p>

		<p>...unless a limit is also used (which should itself be unusual)</p>
		<p><b>Rationale:</b> We often order data when querying directly, but make sure to remove this ORDER BY clause when saving the query as a derived table, as the sort order does not ultimately affect the table, but does cause the query to use more resources.</p>
	</details>
<details id="t13"><!-- First/last via aggregates, not sorts -->

<details id="t14"><!-- No dynamic persisted tables -->

	<p>To clarify, liquid/dynamic SQL in non-persisted, aka ephemeral, derived tables is fine.</p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> Triggered persistent tables usually don't have the necessary explore context to correctly evaluate the dynamic logic. And even persists_for derived tables do not work as expected with dynamic SQL (confirmed as of v5.14)</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> One possible exception may be {{_model._name}}, but still be careful.</p>

<details id="t15"><!-- UNION ALL -->
	<summary><b>T15.</b>UNION should not be used where UNION ALL is needed or sufficient</summary>

	<p><b>Note:</b> In the EAV example, even though the first part of the primary key, the distribution key, and the sort key all result in `entity_id`, writing them out multiple times with the different key dimensions communicates what they do to anyone reading the join, and should have negligible performance impact.</p>

	<p><b>Note:</b> This is all that's needed if the filtered table is the base of an explore with only left or inner joins.
