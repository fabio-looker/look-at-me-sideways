<h1 id="primary-keys">Primary Keys Dimensions</h1>
<p>If there is one concept in database work whose importance could not be overstated, it's primary keys. Know them, communicate them, and trust them.</p>


<details id="k1"> <!-- Primary keys required -->
	<summary><b>K1.</b> Every LookML view that is based on a table must define 1 or more Primary Key Dimensions.</summary>
	<p><b>Note:</b> "based on a table" could be either through a `sql_table_name`, `derived_table`, or implicit table name. Essentially, it's any view that's not a "field-only view" which will be joined using `join: {sql ;;}`</p>

	<code>
	view: carriers {
	  sql_table_name: faa.carriers ;;
	  dimension: 1pk_carrier_id {
	    hidden: yes
	    primary_key: yes
	    sql:${TABLE}.id;;
	  }
	</code>

	</details>

<details id="k2"> <!-- Primary key naming -->	
	<summary><b>K2.</b> Primary Key Dimensions must be named like `<n>pk_<key_name>`...</summary>
	<p>..., where n is the total number of columns that form the primary key, and which may be omitted if it is 1, and key_name is any descriptive name.</p>
	<p>**Rationale:** With this naming convention, anyone creating a join can conclusively find the correct logic without having to investigate:</p>

	<img src="https://discourse.looker.com/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f3be7728c8ecdeaa3b94dabe4a8824b678282842.png" width="381" height="117" />

	<p>Additionally, anyone reading the join could conclusively verify it. </p>

	<h5>Example</h5>

	```
	view: membership {
	   sql_table_name: membership ;;
	   dimension: 2pk_user_id {hidden:yes sql:${TABLE}.user_id;;}
	   dimension: 2pk_group_id {hidden:yes sql:${TABLE}.group_id;;}
	   dimension: user_x_group {
	      hidden:yes 
	      primary_key: yes 
	      sql: ${2pk_user_id} || 'x' || ${2pk_group_id} ;;
	   }
	}

	explore: invitations {
	  join: membership {
	    relationship: many_to_one
	    sql_on: ${membership.2pk_user_id} = ${invitations.to_user_id}
	      AND   ${membership.2pk_group_id} = ${invitations.group_id} ;;
	    # ^ I can tell there MUST be only one membership. Looks good.
	  }
	}
	explore: users {
	  join: membership {
	    relationship: many_to_one
	    sql_on: ${membership.2pk_user_id} = ${users.id} ;;
	    # Uh-oh, something is wrong here!
	  }
	}
	```

	<h5>Notes</h5>

	<ul>
	<li> The number can (and must) be 0 in the rare case that you are working with a table with no primary key.
	<li> For keys with more than one column, all the numbers should be equal to the total number of columns. So, `3pk_a`, `3pk_b`, and `3pk_c`, NOT `1pk_a`, `2pk_b`, and `3pk_c`
	<li> For keys with more than one columns, this does mean you would need to define it in two ways. Once this way, and once as a single concatenated dimension with `primary_key: yes` (if necessary) so Looker can use it for generating symmetric aggregates. This is a small price to pay for the many instances of time saved looking up primary key information when writing/reading explores.
	</ul>

	</details>

<details id="k3" > <!-- Primary key location -->
	<summary><b>K3.</b> Primary Key Dimensions must be defined immediately following the table definition...</summary>
	<p>... and the table definition _should_ be defined before any other dimensions.</p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> By placing primary keys immediately below a derived table definition, users viewing the view file can effortlessly verify that the primary key dimensions match the derived table's grouping (per rule T...).</p>
	</details>

<details id="k4"> <!-- Primary key hidden -->
	<summary><b>K?.</b> Primary Keys Dimensions must be hidden?	</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> The audience for PK information is developers. They use it to inform how to join and consume tables, and they can do so equally well with a hidden field.</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> If a column that is a primary key should be user facing, it should be exposed via a separate dimension.</p>
	</details> 

<details id="k5"> <!-- Primary keys used -->
	<summary><b>K5.</b> The "one" table in any join must be joined on equality constraints on all of the Primary Key Dimensions</summary>
	<p> This is relevant for any 1:1, 1:m, m:1, 1:0or1 joins. In otherwords, any non-many-to-many join (which you should only be using with great caution)</p>
	</h5>Examples</h5>

	<p>GOOD:</p>

	<code class="d-b">
	join: users {
	  relationship: many_to_one
	  sql_on: ${1pk_user_id} = ${orders.user_id} ;;
	}
	</code>

	<p>BAD:</p>

	```
	join: users {
	  relationship: many_to_one
	  sql_on: ${users.id} = ${orders.user_id} ;;
	  # ^ I can only _hope_ that this is right, or spend time verifying it
	}
	```

	<p>QUESTIONABLE:</p>

	```
	join: dates {
	  relationship: many_to_many
	  sql_on: ${dates.1pk_date} >= $[users.created_date} AND ${dates.1pk_date} <= $[users.deleted_date} ;; 
	}
	```

	</details>



<h1 id="data-transformation">Data Transformation</h1>
<p>Whether you're using Looker's derived tables or an external transformation tool like DBT, these practices apply. Of course, using PDT's allows you to enforce these rules all in one place.</p>

<details id="t1"> <!-- Primary keys required --> 
	<summary><b>T1.</b> Except for exceptions in T8 & T9, every query, derived table, CTE, or subquery must select a set of primary key columns following rules T2-T7</summary>
	</details>

<details id="t2"> <!-- Primary key naming --> 
	<summary><b>T2.</b> Primary key columns must be named like {n}pk_{column_name}...</summary>
	<p>...where {n} is the total number of columns in the primary key
	</details>

<details id="t3"> <!-- Primary key positioning --> 
	<summary><b>T3.</b> Primary key columns must be the first columns in the SELECT clause</summary>
	</details>


<details id="t4"> <!-- Grouped PK starts... --> 
	<summary><b>T4.</b> For grouped queries, the PK must start with one, more, or all of the grouped columns</summary>
	</details>

<details id="t5"> <!-- Ungrouped PK starts... -->
	<summary><b>T5.</b> For ungrouped queries, the PK must start with one, more, or all of the PK's from the many-joined tables</summary>
	
	<h5>Notes</h5>
	<ul>
	<li>In most cases, unless you _intend_ to use a window function to create sequence numbers within a partition, the primary key should simply be ALL of the grouped by fields.</li>
	<li>If you want to join this derived table on only a subset of it's PK, what you probably want is a a separate derived table that groups by ONLY those columns and aggregates the rest (see example below)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h5>Examples</h5>
	
	BAD
	```
	view: instance_daily {derived_table: {sql:
	SELECT
		events.instance_id as 2pk_instance_id,
		events.event_date as 2pk_event_date,
		---
		events.app_version,
		COUNT(*) as events
	FROM events
	GROUP BY 1,2,3
	;;}}
	```
	
	QUESTIONABLE
	```
	view: instance_daily {derived_table: {sql:
	SELECT
		events.instance_id as 3pk_instance_id,
		events.event_date as 3pk_event_date,
		events.app_version as 3pk_app_version,
		---
		COUNT(*) as events
	FROM events
	GROUP BY 1,2,3
	;;}}
	```
	
	QUESTIONABLE
	```
	view: instance_daily {derived_table: {sql:
	SELECT 
		events.instance_id as 3pk_instance_id,
		events.event_date as 3pk_event_date,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY events.instance_id, events.event_date
		) as 3pk_app_version_sequence
		---
		events.app_version,
		COUNT(*) as events
	FROM events
	GROUP BY 1,2
	;;}}
	```
	Although the above two "questionable" examples satisfy rules T5 & T6, you will likely find that it is not natural to join them on their entire primary key when you try to use them elsewhere. 
	
	GOOD
	```
	view: instance_daily {derived_table: {sql:
	SELECT 
		events.instance_id as 2pk_instance_id,
		events.event_date as 2pk_event_date,
		---
		MAX(events.app_version) as app_version,
		-- Maybe min too depending on business logic
		COUNT(*) as events
	FROM events
	GROUP BY 1,2
	```

	<summary>Views/derived tables, CTEs, and subqueries may SELECT  and non-pk projections FROM a single table</summary>

<details id="t8"> <!-- PK ends with - - - -->
	<summary>Primary keys columns end with "---" on its own line</summary>
		
	</details>

<details id="t9"> <!-- SELECT 1 col allowed -->
	<summary>Subqueries and CTEs may SELECT a single column without declaring primary keys</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> Often, short subqueries are desired for existence or scalar logic that are (a) not reused outside of the current query, and (b) simple enough to read and understand that they can be analyzed in the context of the containing query with little added complexity</p>
	<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
		
	```
	view: new_orders {derived_table:{sql:
	SELECT
		1pk_order_id
	FROM orders
	WHERE order_date > (SELECT MAX(order_date) FROM order_rollup)
					 -- ^ This single-column subquery is exempt
	;;}}
	```
	
	```
	view: pending_users {derived_table:{sql:
	SELECT

	FROM users
	WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM orders WHERE status='Pending')
	           -- ^ This single-column subquery is exempt
	;;}}

<details id="t10"> <!-- SELECT * from one table -->
	<summary><b>T9.</b> Queries may SELECT &#42; (plus any non-pk columns) FROM a single table/subquery</summary>

	<p>1. Internally, by placing them at the top of the selected columns, and separated from the remaining columns by "---" on its own line</p>
	<p>2. Externally, by naming them like <n>pk_<column_name>, where n is the number of columns in the primary key, and column_name is any identifying name</p>

	<summary>F...Avoid Inter-View Dependencies</summary>

###F... No View Labeled Fields
Fields should not contain a view_label.


<details> <!-- Explore-specific fields/views -->
	<summary>
###F... Explore-Specific Views


**Rationale:** Field-level view labels can't be overridden by a join. Prefer view-level view labels.

###F... Codimension Views & Joins
Codimension views may be replicated for a specific explore or set of view dependencies.

Codimension views should contain only one dimension or dimension group.

Codimension joins should realias codimensions views to a global name.



###F... Count Fields
All "plain" count fields must specify a filter of "primary key dimensions are not null"

**Rationale:** By default Looker will implement a plain count field as a `COUNT(*)`. Forcing a filter on the primary key ensure correct counts in all of the following uses of the field: Counting just that table, counting that table when joined on as a one-to-one-or-zero table,
